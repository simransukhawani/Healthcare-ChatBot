# Multi-Language Healthcare Chatbot

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a multi-language healthcare chatbot capable of providing personalized health advice based on user input and a pre-uploaded dataset. The chatbot supports multiple languages and delivers responses tailored to the severity of the condition described by the user.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Language Support:** Handles English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, and Telugu.
- **Context-Based Interaction:** Provides health advice based on a pre-uploaded medical dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Includes metrics for assessing chatbot response accuracy and perplexity.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini-1.5 Flash Model):** For natural language generation.
- **Python:** Utilized in Google Colab with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Cloud Storage:** Google Drive is used for storing and uploading dataset files.
